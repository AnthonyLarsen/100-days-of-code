## Log

### R1D1 
Today I made text responsive with an HTML e-mail template using CSS & media queries and I continued my Bootstrap education with FreeCodeCamp. Looking forward to what tomorrow will bring.

### R1D2
Today I worked through FreeCodeCamp's jQuery challenges and I also made the realization that I never finished the HTML/CSS challenges. Looks like I know what I'll be doing tomorrow. jQuery was interesting to learn, I'll need to come back to get the syntax down.

### R1D3
This afternoon's challenge was to see how many HTML/CSS challenges I could get through in an hour. I ended up completeing all of the HTML/CSS challenges in about 2ish hours. Had to take a couple breaks for family obligations. Things are starting to make more sense. Can't wait for tomorrow. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/950212980615954432

### R1D4
Tonight I finished up the FreeCodeCamp Bootstrap section of challenges and I did some research for my Codepen tribute page I'll be starting tomorrow. Slowly but surely making progress with my education.

### R1D5
Tonight I started my tribute page and I was able to add a number of the needed user stories for this challenge. I need to figure out how to center my image inside of the div and finish up the bottom sections tomorrow. Feeling good.

### R1D6
Tonight I fixed the image issue I was having yesterday and I finished my tribute page. I'm happy I was able to execute this challenge in the timeframe I did, but I know I will need to continue to learn more about Bootstrap and how the different grid systems work together to be able to create more complex pages in the future. Here's to more learning in the coming days!

### R1D7
Tonight I continued my Bootstrap education by reading through some articles on Bootstrap grid layout because I will be starting my portfolio page tomorrow evening. I can't wait to get started on this challenge as I will be able to use this site to help me get future freelance work. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/951795667344781312
