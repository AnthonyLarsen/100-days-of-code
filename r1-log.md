## Log

### R1D1 
Today I made text responsive with an HTML e-mail template using CSS & media queries and I continued my Bootstrap education with FreeCodeCamp. Looking forward to what tomorrow will bring.

### R1D2
Today I worked through FreeCodeCamp's jQuery challenges and I also made the realization that I never finished the HTML/CSS challenges. Looks like I know what I'll be doing tomorrow. jQuery was interesting to learn, I'll need to come back to get the syntax down.

### R1D3
This afternoon's challenge was to see how many HTML/CSS challenges I could get through in an hour. I ended up completeing all of the HTML/CSS challenges in about 2ish hours. Had to take a couple breaks for family obligations. Things are starting to make more sense. Can't wait for tomorrow. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/950212980615954432

### R1D4
Tonight I finished up the FreeCodeCamp Bootstrap section of challenges and I did some research for my Codepen tribute page I'll be starting tomorrow. Slowly but surely making progress with my education.

### R1D5
Tonight I started my tribute page and I was able to add a number of the needed user stories for this challenge. I need to figure out how to center my image inside of the div and finish up the bottom sections tomorrow. Feeling good.

### R1D6
Tonight I fixed the image issue I was having yesterday and I finished my tribute page. I'm happy I was able to execute this challenge in the timeframe I did, but I know I will need to continue to learn more about Bootstrap and how the different grid systems work together to be able to create more complex pages in the future. Here's to more learning in the coming days!

### R1D7
Tonight I continued my Bootstrap education by reading through some articles on Bootstrap grid layout because I will be starting my portfolio page tomorrow evening. I can't wait to get started on this challenge as I will be able to use this site to help me get future freelance work. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/951795667344781312

### R1D8 
Today I laid out my portfolio page sections using Bootstrap 4. I think there is still have to gain a better understanding of Bootstrap's columns to layout a webpage. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/952058899200401408

### R1D9
Today was a day filled with coding fun. I read a few coding focused articles, had a chat this evening with another local coder based out of Chicago and I added my collaspable navbar to my portfolio page and updated the font using Goolefonts. Can't wait to see what tomorrow brings. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/952431343694213121

### R1D10
Today I felt that I needed to refocus my portfolio so I cut out all of the placeholder code and added a hero image with a linear gradient. Started at the top and I will be working my way down. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/952776102983938049

### R1D11
Tonight it seemed like nothing worked today. The code definitely won, but I promise I'll be back tomorrow ready to learn more.

### R1D17
Tonight I started to mock up a wireframe for a client project I will be starting in a few weeks, checked out the Odin Project, and I added some mock websites to my web design project section of my portfolio.

### R1D18
I took my graphic design section of the portfolio and made it 2 rows so the images scale much nicer now when reducing the screen size. I also joined Code Newbie's #CNC2018 Start Coding Challenge and read through Mission One - Roles, Goals, Reality.

### R1D20
Last night I learned how to increase the size of my social icons by adding an fa-3x class, unstuck my navbar since it was causing issues when the link clicks centered on the different portfolio sections and I used CSS to add brand colors to the icons.
