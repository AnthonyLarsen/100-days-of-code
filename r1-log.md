### R1D2
Today I worked through FreeCodeCamp's jQuery challenges and I also made the realization that I never finished the HTML/CSS challenges. Looks like I know what I'll be doing tomorrow. jQuery was interesting to learn, I'll need to come back to get the syntax down.

### R1D3
This afternoon's challenge was to see how many HTML/CSS challenges I could get through in an hour. I ended up completeing all of the HTML/CSS challenges in about 2ish hours. Had to take a couple breaks for family obligations. Things are starting to make more sense. Can't wait for tomorrow. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/950212980615954432

### R1D4
Tonight I finished up the FreeCodeCamp Bootstrap section of challenges and I did some research for my Codepen tribute page I'll be starting tomorrow. Slowly but surely making progress with my education.

### R1D5
Tonight I started my tribute page and I was able to add a number of the needed user stories for this challenge. I need to figure out how to center my image inside of the div and finish up the bottom sections tomorrow. Feeling good.

### R1D6
Tonight I fixed the image issue I was having yesterday and I finished my tribute page. I'm happy I was able to execute this challenge in the timeframe I did, but I know I will need to continue to learn more about Bootstrap and how the different grid systems work together to be able to create more complex pages in the future. Here's to more learning in the coming days!

### R1D7
Tonight I continued my Bootstrap education by reading through some articles on Bootstrap grid layout because I will be starting my portfolio page tomorrow evening.

### R1D8 
Today I laid out my portfolio page sections using Bootstrap 4. I think there is still have to gain a better understanding of Bootstrap's columns to layout a webpage. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/952058899200401408

### R1D9
Today was a day filled with coding fun. I read a few coding focused articles, had a chat this evening with another local coder based out of Chicago and I added my collaspable navbar to my portfolio page and updated the font using Goolefonts. Can't wait to see what tomorrow brings. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/952431343694213121

### R1D10
Today I felt that I needed to refocus my portfolio so I cut out all of the placeholder code and added a hero image with a linear gradient. Started at the top and I will be working my way down. Twitter - https://twitter.com/anthonydlarsen/status/952776102983938049

### R1D11
Tonight it seemed like nothing worked today. The code definitely won, but I promise I'll be back tomorrow ready to learn more.
